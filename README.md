# Sprinkler System

## Mike Gauthier

### Written in python for Raspberry Pi 3

This is a work in progress. Currently writing a sprinkler system object that 
will be able to turn on/off pumps and zones via a relay board and check a 
schedule. Schedules will be written via an LCD display menu program with
buttons or a shell program which can be accessed thru the RPi3's WiFi 
connection.
